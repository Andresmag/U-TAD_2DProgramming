# Master's Degree in Video game programming at U-Tad
## 2D Programming

Practices for the subject 2D Programming.

* Practice 1: Drawing of graphical primitives. Trigonometric calculations.
* Practice 2: Textures and blending modes.
* Practice 3: Text rendering.
* Practice 4: Sprites and animation.
* Practice 5: Collisions.
* Practice 6: The World. Camera and scroll control.
* Practice 7: Loading maps.

Every practice is an improvement from the last one so a lot of the code is reused.
But you should look at it closely because sometimes although it's really similar it has a little change.

*In the practice 5, the collision per pixels between the bee and the circle is not working fine but after
checking the code several times I couldn't find the error.*
